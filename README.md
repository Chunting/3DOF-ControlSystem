Project:
3 DOF Control System & Simulation

Description:
Develop a dynamic control system to enable a 3 DOF robot arm to balance a frictionless object on its end while moving to a target trajectory. The system was tested successful and capable of reaching the extremes of the workspace within 20 seconds on a custom simulation model.
